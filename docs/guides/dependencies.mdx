title: "Dependencies"
description: "Add shared utility modules to the Python path for your graphs."
---

When your graphs need to import from shared utility modules that aren't installed as packages, use the `dependencies` config to add those paths to `sys.path` before graphs are loaded.

## Configuration

Add the `dependencies` array to your `aegra.json`:

```json
{
  "graphs": {
    "agent": "./graphs/agent/graph.py:graph"
  },
  "dependencies": [
    "./shared",
    "./libs/common"
  ]
}
```

### Path resolution

- Relative paths are resolved from the config file's directory
- Absolute paths are used as-is
- Paths are added to `sys.path` in order (first has highest priority)
- Non-existent paths generate a warning but don't prevent startup

## Example

Given this project structure:

```
my-project/
├── aegra.json
├── graphs/
│   └── my_agent/
│       └── graph.py
├── shared/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── utils.py
│   └── prompts.py
└── libs/
    └── custom_tools/
        └── __init__.py
```

Configure dependencies:

```json
{
  "graphs": {
    "my_agent": "./graphs/my_agent/graph.py:graph"
  },
  "dependencies": [
    "./shared",
    "./libs"
  ]
}
```

Then import directly in your graph:

```python
# graphs/my_agent/graph.py
from utils import format_response
from prompts import SYSTEM_PROMPT
from custom_tools import MyCustomTool
```

## Logging

When dependencies are configured, you'll see:

```
INFO: Added dependency path to sys.path: /app/shared
INFO: Added dependency path to sys.path: /app/libs
```

If a path doesn't exist:

```
WARNING: Dependency path does not exist: /app/missing_path
```
