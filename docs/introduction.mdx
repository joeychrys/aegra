Aegra is an open-source, self-hosted Agent Protocol server that lets you run AI agents on your own infrastructure. It's a drop-in replacement for LangSmith Deployments — same SDK, same APIs, no vendor lock-in. Read [why teams choose Aegra](/why-aegra) over managed platforms, or jump straight to the [migration guide](/migration) if you're switching.

## Before you begin

## What Aegra does

Aegra gives you a production-ready server for running LangGraph agents with full persistence, streaming, and authentication. You bring your own PostgreSQL database and keep complete control over your data.
