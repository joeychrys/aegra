# Aegra

> Open-source, self-hosted Agent Protocol server for running AI agents on your own infrastructure.

Aegra is a production-ready server for running LangGraph agents with full persistence, streaming, and authentication. It uses the same LangGraph SDK and Agent Protocol APIs, so existing graph code, client libraries, and frontends (Agent Chat UI, LangGraph Studio, CopilotKit) work without modification. Self-hosted on your own PostgreSQL database with zero per-run costs, flexible auth (JWT/OAuth/Firebase), and open tracing via OpenTelemetry to any OTLP backend.
