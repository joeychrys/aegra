Aegra is an open-source, self-hosted Agent Protocol server that lets you run AI agents on your own infrastructure. It's a drop-in replacement for LangGraph Platform — same SDK, same APIs, no vendor lock-in. Read [why teams choose Aegra](/why-aegra) over managed platforms, or jump straight to the [migration guide](/migration) if you're switching from LangSmith Deployments.

## Before you begin

<Tip>
  **Using an AI coding tool?** Add the Aegra docs MCP server for better results when building with Aegra.

## What Aegra does

Aegra gives you a production-ready server for running LangGraph agents with full persistence, streaming, and authentication. You bring your own PostgreSQL database and keep complete control over your data.

| **Authentication** | Limited options | Custom (JWT/OAuth/Firebase) |
| **Database** | Managed, no BYO | Bring your own Postgres |
| **Tracing** | LangSmith only | Your choice (Langfuse, Phoenix, any OTLP) |
| **SDK** | LangGraph SDK | Same LangGraph SDK |
